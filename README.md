# weatherDashboard
This app is a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS. You can search up 
places by city name, and each time you search a city it will be saved into local storage and displayed on screen in a list.
Each of those list items is clickable and will place the attached city name into the search bar so you can easily revisit old
searches.

When a city is searched the page will display the weather, date, and a five day forecast of the weather to come. This forecast 
will update each time a new city is searched along side the weather and date of the current day.

There is also a button to delete the previous searched cities from both the display onscreen and from local storage.
